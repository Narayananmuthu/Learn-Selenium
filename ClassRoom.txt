=============================

Why java?
WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere
     - PlatformInDependency ( .class/Byte code)

IDE - netBeans, eclipse, IJ

How much do I need JAVA for test automation?

Step 1:
Set up the enviroment: 
    Install Java and Eclipse

About Eclipse: 
   Editor, console.
   Create a Maven project, Package, class
   Groupid : Name of the company/Organisation
   Artifact id : UPPER Case

Created a (Maven) project Same as Group id
Created a package (Lower case)
Craeted a class (Pascal case)

Java Reserved Keywords: bold, lowerCase

Step 2:
------
Naming conventions for class:(Pascal case)
          - Pascal Case (PascalCase): In this the first letter of every word is in capital letter.

         MyFirstJavaProgram


Create a small java program 
               main method 
                public : To call by JVM from anywhere we declare as public.
                static : without existing object also JVM has to call this method so declared as static.
                void : main method wont return anything to JVM hence declared as void.
                main() : name of the method
                (String [ ] args) :   These are command line arguments used to receive input from user

  	   Compile - Shortcuts cntrl F11 or RunAs--> java Application --> green button

Platform Independant:
-------------------
   	   Show the class file ( Byte code- OS independant)
    Explain the platform dependency:  

To view the Project folder in the system explorer:
--------------------------------------------------
   click on Project --> Properties --> show in System Explorer

variable -
data types:

1. Primitive :

int, char, float, short, byte, double, long, boolean
 
2. Non primitive:(class)
String, Arrays..

=================================================
Operators:
---------
+
-
*
/
%
<
>
<=
=
==
!=

===================================================

Control Statements:

1. Iterative/looping
2. Conditional
3. Jumping Statements

Conditional:
------------

check if a number is positive or negative

check if a number is positive or negative or neutral


ClassRoom 1:
Get an integer
int num = 21;
If the number is divisible by 3, print as TRIZZ
If the number is divisible by 5, print as FIZZ
If the number is divisible both by 3 and 5, print as TRIZZ-FIZZ
else
not divisible both by 3 or 5

 % - remainder
    number%3 -> remainder =0
if(number%3 ==0 && number%5 ==0){
}

ClassRoom2:
Check if the number is positive or a negative number


ITERATIVE Statement:













 





What can I do with it?
